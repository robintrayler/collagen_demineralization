# Comments from the editors 

* The submitted manuscript by Trayler et al. provides a valuable contribution to methodological considerations in stable isotope analysis; I concur with both reviewers that following modest revisions, this paper is a suitable contribution to JAS and more broadly to isotope bioarchaeology/zooarchaeology.

## Overview
This paper investigates the timing and efficacy of the removal of mineral (0.1 M HCL) from bone and tooth dentin using FTIR measurements. The study reinforces the need to remove structural carbonates from bone and dentinal collagen in order to obtain accurate stable C and N isotope measurements. The main conclusion is that FTIR can be used to track mineral loss in samples, which is useful for isotope researchers working with bone and tooth collagen samples. This paper does have significant merit and provides a procedure for evaluating demineralization times. I can see this being useful in the early phases of a research project in estimating ideal treatment times that are tailored to a set of samples of similar preservation. The main concerns regarding the manuscript is that there are only three samples used and they are all different taxa. A larger sample size would provide more robust results and confidence in the conclusions. However, I understand that the authors were more interesting in showing these data as proof of concept. **A more extensive literature review should be included that minimally covers how FTIR has been used to examine collagen and mineral properties.** I realize most of the literature is about diagenesis (not sample treatment times and efficacy) but some discussion is warranted. **There are also other methods that have been used to determine whether samples are still reacting with HCl as an indication of demineralization. This should be discussed as well**.

## Minor comments
* Abstract (page 1): SIA of bone and dentinal collagen is more commonly used on more recent archaeological remains (human and nonhuman fauna) than on extinct human and animal remains (where collagen preservation is more variable). I would rephrase this sentence to reflect this. Line 20: remove second "of" after "efficacy-of"

* Introduction (page 2: line 31): Collagen preservation from Middle Pleistocene samples is pretty rare based on my understanding of the literature. I would rephrase this sentence. 

> We have changed this to say "Late Pleistocene"

* Lines 37: "contains significant nitrogen contents" is awkward phrasing. 

> We have reworded this sentence to be less awkward. It now reads "has a significant nitrogen content..."

* Introduction (page 3: lines 58-60): It's unclear why results are being presented already in the Introduction section. Most of "Page 3" is really Materials and Methods and seems out of place here.

* Elemental Composition of Bone (page 5: line 96): "collagen" is misspelled

lines 108-109: Sodium hydroxide is routinely used to remove contaminants from old samples (instead of saying "sometimes").

* Collagen Extraction (page 6: lines 124-125): In general, the Pestle et al. (2014) study found C and N collagen to be comparable but there were a couple of labs with results that deviated strongly from the average for all labs.

## Overview

This is a nice short study on the need for mineral removal before collagen analysis and fits into the larger ecosystem of testing what we think we know about stable isotope analysis, with recent papers on quality control, body size effects, and the effects of bone turnover. The authors set up the study well and used varied materials of interest to the question at hand. The resulting quick demineralization of most samples was interesting as I was expecting a weak HCl solution to slow down the demineralization time. I did appreciate the easy to read graphics, which can be difficult in papers like these with multiple samples from multiple individuals and varied treatments. **Wondering if it should be stated a bit more clearly that perhaps the slow reaction time in Prionace teeth was due to the high mineral content of teeth?** I would publish with minor revisions, as this paper quite nicely shows the necessary step of removing mineral from collagen.
